            <p>I'm an undergraduate at UW–Madison, broadly interested in helping ensure highly capable AI benefits humanity through technical research, policy, strategy, and field-building. I'm currently a Summer Research Fellow at UChicago's <a href="https://xrisk.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XLab</a> and the Director of the <a href="https://waisi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wisconsin AI Safety Initiative</a>. I'm always down to chat!</p>

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>I'm actively involved in technical research, interested in anything I think will help make AI safer, more secure, and better for people. This includes security and safety in multi-agent systems, understanding reasoning in LLMs, and data/compute efficiency for safety techniques.</p>
          <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>I'm a 2025 Summer Research Fellow at UChicago's Existential Risks Lab, where I'm advised by <a href="https://lewishammond.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lewis Hammond</a>, working on preventing adversarial attacks on multi-agent systems. I'm also meeting many wonderful, motivated people working on important issues!</li>
            <li>I work with Prof. <a href="https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~zhong35/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yiqiao Zhong</a> to understand LLM reasoning and RL post-training.</li>
            <li>I do research with <a href="https://uppaal.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rheeya Uppaal</a> (PhD Candidate) in Prof. <a href="https://junjiehu.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Junjie Hu</a>'s lab on the emergence of generalization and compute-efficient model editing/fine-tuning.</li>
            <li>Last summer, I completed the <a href="https://www.arena.education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alignment Research Engineer Accelerator</a> (ARENA) curriculum. I highly recommend others check it out, I've found no better way to quickly upskill in ML Safety.</li>

          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>I'm a rising junior pursuing a B.S. in Computer Sciences (with Honors), Data Science, and Mathematics with a Certificate in Public Policy at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.</p>
          <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>GPA: 4.0</li>
            <li>I received the top overall score (110.45%) in Spring 2025 for CS 577: Introduction to Algorithms, recognized as one of UW-Madison's most difficult and prestigious undergraduate courses.</li>
            <li>Relevant Coursework: Matrix Methods in Machine Learning, Big Data Systems, Algorithms, Machine Organization and Programming, Theory of Probability, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, Data Modeling I and II, Programming II and III, Intro to Computer Engineering, Data Ethics and Policy</li>

          <h2>Leadership & Involvement</h2>
          <p>I'm proud to help lead the Wisconsin AI Safety Initiative. WAISI's mission is to pragmatically guide the development of advanced AI towards a future that benefits everyone. I've spent the last year as Operations Lead, and am now the Director of WAISI.</p>
          <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>We have 50+ members of our advanced reading groups across (at least) 12 different ML labs on campus. We also run rigorous technical and policy introductory programs for about 50 students each semester.</li>
            <li>I lead one of our technical reading groups, and participate in one of our policy groups (and, when I have time, another one of our technical groups). We read papers ranging from mechanistic interpretability to genomic language models to deep-dives on the semiconductor supply chain.</li>
            <li>We've hosted speaker events with staff from Anthropic, Google DeepMind, METR, CNAS, and more, as well as many professors. Last fall, we hosted an interdisciplinary panel on AI, featuring faculty from Education, Computer Sciences, and Philosophy.</li>
            <li>I lead our 30 person (and growing) leadership team. I'm extremely grateful for the hard work everyone puts in to make this organization possible.</li>

        <section id="policy-work">
          <h2>Policy Work</h2>
          <p>I'm also very interested in tech policy! I deeply believe that making well-informed, evidence-based, effective policy is one of the most impactful things one can do.</p>
          <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>This spring, WAISI members (including me!) presented to officials and Congressional staffers at the <a href="https://www.centeraipolicy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Center for AI Policy</a> (CAIP)'s Advanced AI Expo in Washington, DC. My team developed an interactive demo showcasing the security risks in LLM-based multiagent systems, demonstrating how a single public-facing component could cause a prompt-injection attack to cascade throughout the system.</li>
            <li>I'm a founding member of CAIP's Policy Advocacy Network. I hope to present our demos to many officials and staffers, sparking careful and effective policy across all levels of government.</li>

          <h2>Personal</h2>
          <p>I'm a proud Minnesotan, and love the lakes, outdoors, cold, and snow. I spent years as a competitive swimmer, captained my high school team, and worked during summers as a lifeguard. I still love to swim, especially outdoors (though am wildly slower than I was a few years ago). The furthest I've gone continuously was about 8 miles. I've also been a vegetarian the past five years (but, in true Wisconsin fashion, still love cheese). Some other things I like:</p>
          <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>Tolkien, Star Wars, GoT, Eragon, and other very mainstream pieces of fantasy/sci-fi media.</li>
            <li>History of (China, Egypt, English, Rome, Byzantium, England) Podcasts, Huberman Labs, Dwarkesh Patel, and the 80k Hours Podcast. I spent a <b>lot</b> of hours listening to podcasts on the beach.</li>
            <li>Robotics including First Lego League, First Tech Challenge, and Drone Team at Wisconsin Robotics.</li>
            <li>Civilization V, Kerbal Space Program, Subnautica, Portal, Horizon: Zero Dawn/Forbidden West, etc.</li>
			<li>Minnesota sports teams (it's disheartening). Maybe this year we'll finally win something...</li>
