            <p>I'm an undergraduate at UW–Madison, passionate about helping ensure highly capable AI benefits humanity through technical research, policy, strategy, and field-building. I do multi-agent safety research at UChicago's <a href="https://xrisk.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XLab</a> and am the Director of the <a href="https://waisi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wisconsin AI Safety Initiative</a>. I'm always down to chat!</p>

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>I'm involved in technical research, interested in anything I think will help make AI better for people. This includes AI security, multi-agent safety, and understanding reasoning in LLMs.</p>
          <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>I was a 2025 Summer Research Fellow at UChicago's Existential Risk Lab, where I was advised by <a href="https://lewishammond.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lewis Hammond</a>, working on security in multi-agent systems. I also met many wonderful, motivated people working on important issues! I'll be extending my work with Lewis into the fall.</li>
            <li>I'm collaborating on a few other projects, including developing adversarial examples to military CV models, studying the impact of network topology on multi-agent security, and analyzing the feasibility of kinetic action to deter superintelligence projects (spoiler: it's not that easy)</li>
            <li>I work with Prof. <a href="https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~zhong35/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yiqiao Zhong</a> to understand LLM reasoning and RL post-training.</li>
            <li>I spent a year doing research with <a href="https://uppaal.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rheeya Uppaal</a> (PhD Candidate) in Prof. <a href="https://junjiehu.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Junjie Hu</a>'s lab on the emergence of generalization and compute-efficient model editing/fine-tuning.</li>
            <li>Last summer, I completed the <a href="https://www.arena.education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alignment Research Engineer Accelerator</a> (ARENA) curriculum. I highly recommend others check it out, I've found no better way to quickly upskill in ML Safety.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="education">
          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>I'm a junior at the University of Wisconsin–Madison working on a B.S. in Computer Sciences (with Honors), Data Science, and Mathematics with a Certificate in Public Policy.</p>
          <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>GPA: 4.0</li>
            <li>I received the top overall score (110.45%) in Spring 2025 for CS 577: Introduction to Algorithms, recognized as one of UW-Madison's most difficult and prestigious undergraduate courses.</li>
            <li>Relevant Coursework: Matrix Methods in Machine Learning, Big Data Systems, Algorithms, Machine Organization and Programming, Theory of Probability, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, Data Science Modeling I and II, Programming II and III, Intro to Computer Engineering, Data Ethics and Policy</li>

        <section id="leadership">
          <h2>Leadership & Involvement</h2>
          <p>I'm proud to be the Director of the Wisconsin AI Safety Initiative, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization of technical and policy researchers dedicated to guiding the development of advanced AI towards a future that benefits everyone.</p>
          <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>We have 130+ members, including 80+ in our advanced reading groups across (at least) 12 different ML labs on campus. We also run rigorous technical and policy introductory programs for about 50 students each semester.</li>
            <li>I lead one of our technical reading groups, and participate in one of our policy groups. We read papers ranging from mechanistic interpretability to genomic language models to deep-dives on the semiconductor supply chain.</li>
            <li>We've hosted speaker events with staff from Anthropic, Google DeepMind, METR, CNAS, and more, as well as many professors. Last fall, we hosted an interdisciplinary panel on AI, featuring faculty from Education, Computer Sciences, and Philosophy.</li>
            <li>I direct our 30 person (and growing) leadership team. I'm extremely grateful for the hard work everyone puts in to make this organization possible.</li>
            <li>I also serve as a mentor for other AI Safety student organizers through <a href="https://kairos-project.org/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kairos</a>'s Pathfinder program and am an Advisor for <a href="https://amherst.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/aisa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI Safety at Amherst</a>.</li>

        <section id="policy-work">
          <h2>Policy Work</h2>
          <p>I'm also very interested in tech policy! I deeply believe that making well-informed, evidence-based, effective policy is one of the most impactful things one can do.</p>
          <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>This spring, WAISI members (including me!) presented to officials and Congressional staffers at the <a href="https://www.centeraipolicy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Center for AI Policy</a> (CAIP)'s Advanced AI Expo in Washington, DC. My team developed an interactive demo showcasing security risks in LLM-based multiagent systems, demonstrating how a single public-facing component could cause a prompt-injection attack to cascade throughout the system.</li>
            <li>I'm helping organize a new national AI Policy organization, the Collegiate Coalition for AI Policy (CCAP). Expect to hear more about this soon!</li>

          <p>I'm a proud Minnesotan, and love the lakes, outdoors, cold, and snow. I was a competitive swimmer, captained my high school team, and worked during summers as a lifeguard. I still love to swim, especially outdoors. I've also been a vegetarian the past five years (but, in true Wisconsin fashion, still love cheese). Some other things I like:</p>
          <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>Tolkien, Star Wars, GoT, Eragon, and other very mainstream pieces of fantasy/sci-fi media. Shakespeare (esp. the Henriad and the sonnets 18, 29, 36, 41, 44, 55, 106, 116, 128), Henrik Karlsson (<a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/looking-for-alice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Looking for Alice</a>), <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Alexander</a>, <a href="https://benkuhn.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Kuhn</a>, and many others.</li>
            <li>History of (China, Egypt, English, Rome, Byzantium, England) Podcasts, Huberman Labs, Dwarkesh Patel, and the 80k Hours Podcast. I spent a <b>lot</b> of hours listening to podcasts on the beach.</li>
            <li>Robotics including First Lego League, First Tech Challenge, and Drone Team at Wisconsin Robotics.</li>
            <li>Civilization V, Kerbal Space Program, Subnautica, Portal, Horizon: Zero Dawn/Forbidden West, etc.</li>
