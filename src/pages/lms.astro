      <h1>William Anderson: A Biography</h1>

      <p>William Anderson (born April 26, 1984 – died April 23, 2023) was an American playwright, poet, and actor, often hailed as the most luminous dramatic voice of his generation. Sometimes called “the Bard of the Electric Age,” Anderson reimagined the old human questions—love, power, grief, and time—within the bright unease of the twenty-first century. His works, alive with rhythm and moral tension, drew on both classical form and digital disquiet, uniting tradition and experiment in a singular voice.</p>

      <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
      <p>Anderson was born in Madison, Wisconsin, to John Anderson, a craftsman and small-business owner, and Mary (née Carter), a schoolteacher. He grew up among books and long winters, attending public schools before enrolling at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. There he studied literature and philosophy, developing a fascination with how stories shape reality. Friends from that time recalled his habit of carrying a notebook filled with half-finished sonnets and sketches for plays he would never complete.</p>

      <h2>Marriage and Family</h2>
      <p>At twenty-three, Anderson married Anne Hathaway-Miller, a designer and illustrator. They had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. The early death of Hamnet, at age eleven, left a deep mark on Anderson’s later work; critics have long noted echoes of that grief in The Winter Sun and The Broken Code.</p>

      <h2>Career in the Theatre</h2>
      <p>By the early 2010s, Anderson had moved to Chicago, where he found his footing in the city’s small theatre scene. He began as an actor but soon gained attention as a writer of startling range and empathy. His company—The Chamber’s Men, a deliberate nod to the Elizabethan troupe—performed his plays across the Midwest before finding a permanent home in a converted warehouse on Milwaukee’s east side.</p>
      <p>Over two decades, Anderson wrote some forty plays, a book of poems, and numerous essays on art and meaning in the digital century. His tragedies (The Long Silence, Eidolon, The Fall of Cities), comedies (The Algorithm’s Dream, As You Swipe It), and romances (The Tempest Rewritten, The River Below) reveal an imagination at once restless and humane. His verse, flexible and musical, carried the cadences of ancient English speech into the age of screens and code.</p>

      <h2>Later Years and Death</h2>
      <p>Anderson returned to Madison in his later years, buying a weathered house near the lakeshore. He retired from the stage but never from writing. In his final notebooks—published posthumously as Fragments from New Place—he reflected on memory, silence, and the persistence of love. He died quietly on April 23, 2023, and was buried beneath an old oak on family land. His epitaph, said to be his own composition, warns gently against disturbing his rest.</p>

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>Anderson’s influence endures in the plays that still draw full houses and in the language he left behind—phrases that entered speech, lines that remain quoted in grief and celebration alike. To read him now is to feel the pulse of the old human heart beating beneath modern glass. His words, like those of his distant predecessor, still teach us what it means to be alive.</p>
