      <h1>William Anderson: An Obituary</h1>

      <p>William L. Anderson (1954-2018)
        William Laird Anderson, a playwright and poet who earned modest regional renown for works that explored the social and psychological impact of digital technology, died on April 7, 2018 at his home in Madison, Wisconsin. He was 63.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, according to his wife, Karen Levy Anderson.
        A quiet, somewhat reclusive figure, Mr. Anderson never achieved widespread national attention, but he was a revered presence in the close-knit theater scenes of Chicago and Milwaukee, where his cerebral, poetic plays found appreciative audiences.
        "Bill was our best-kept secret," said Marcus Tillman, the artistic director of Milwaukee's tiny but influential Prometheus Theatre, which staged many of Mr. Anderson's works. "He wasn't chasing fame or Tony Awards. He wrote these beautiful, austere meditations on what it means to be human in the age of the machine."
        William Laird Anderson was born on Nov. 2, 1954, in Appleton, Wisconsin, the eldest of three children of John Anderson, an accountant, and Mary (Seaver) Anderson, an elementary school teacher.
        A bookish, introspective child, he developed an early fascination with science fiction and the works of Samuel Beckett, influences that would later shape his own writing.
        He attended Ripon College, a small liberal arts school in Wisconsin, graduating in 1976 with a degree in theater. After a brief, unhappy stint in New York City, he returned to the Midwest, settling in Chicago.
        There, he found his artistic home in the city's vibrant but undersung off-Loop theater scene. His early plays, including "User Error" (1982) and "The Memo Hole" (1985), won modest local acclaim for their blend of technological themes and Beckettian absurdism.
        In 1988, eager for more creative control, Mr. Anderson co-founded the Prometheus Theatre in Milwaukee with Mr. Tillman and a handful of other Chicago theater expatriates. Though always financially precarious, the 50-seat storefront space would become his primary artistic outlet for the next three decades.
        Mr. Anderson's plays often explored the ways in which digital technology is reshaping human identity, memory, and relationships. Works like "Ghosts in the Machine" (1992), "The Delete Key" (1998), and "Glitch" (2005) grappled with questions of privacy, alienation, and the fragility of human connection in an increasingly networked world.
        "Bill understood that our devices aren't just changing our behaviors; they're changing our souls," said Lila Szewcow, a frequent collaborator who directed many of Mr. Anderson's plays. "He saw the poetry and the peril in that, and he captured it on stage in a way no one else could."
        While Mr. Anderson's plays were heady and often challenging, he had a gift for locating the human heart within the technological labyrinth. His characters often wrestled with grief, loneliness, and the search for meaning in a world increasingly mediated by screens.
        "Even when he was writing about software or cybernetics, he was really writing about the yearnings and fears we all share," Mr. Tillman said.
        When not writing or directing, Mr. Anderson taught humanities courses at several Milwaukee-area colleges, including Marquette University and the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design. He also led playwriting workshops at Tamarack Waldorf High School.
        "He had a real gift for drawing out these startling insights from students who thought of themselves as non-writers," said Maria Valdez, a former student who went on to become a professional playwright. "He made you see the world, and yourself, in a new way."
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Anderson is survived by a brother, James Anderson; a sister, Susan Morelli; and several nieces and nephews.
        Though he never garnered the fame or accolades of some of his peers, Mr. Anderson's impact on those he worked with was profound.
        "Bill was a true artist, in the purest sense of that word," Ms. Szewcow said. "He wrote not for glory or riches, but because he had to, because the writing itself was his way of making sense of this strange, lovely, broken world we all inhabit. His voice will be deeply missed."
